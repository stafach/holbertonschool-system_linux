More Info
Compilation
Your program will be compiled this way:

gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o hls
Every task depends on the previous ones. We strongly encourage you to read the entire project and think about the way you are going to design your entire ls before starting. (This is actually something you should do all the time :).
